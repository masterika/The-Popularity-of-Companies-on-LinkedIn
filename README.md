# The-Popularity-of-Companies-on-LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social network that is mainly used for professional networking, including employers posting jobs and job seekers posting their resumes. Many companies have a web page on the platform which users can follow. The number of followers is essential for companies because not only do they see their content, but by sharing and liking the post, it shows up in more peopleâ€™s feed. Therefore, followers can be used to attract talent. I am interested in finding out what determines the popularity of company webpages on LinkedIn, measured in the number of followers on the platform. So far, I've found that companies that are registered on linkedin with a signle-worded name (e.g. IBM, Spotify) have 300% more followers compared to companies that use multiple words as their registration name (e.g. Snapchat, Inc., The Data Incubator)
